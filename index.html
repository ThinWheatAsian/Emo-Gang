        <h3> The Berserker is a Common card that is unlocked from the Jungle Arena (Arena 9) 
                It spawns a fast, single-target, ground-targeting, melee, ground troop with moderate
                hitpoints and low damage. She appears as a kid who wears a light brown dress made of bear
                skin, dark brown wristbands, and a team-colored belt. She has orange hair, eyes and eyebrows,
                a loose tooth, and a scar on her left chin, arms and legs, and wields a pair of cleavers.
                    A Berserker card costs 2 Elixir to deploy.
            </h3>
